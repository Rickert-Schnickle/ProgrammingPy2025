If you do either of these things, you should see the text \"Hello, world!\" appear beneath the code. Did that work? (I'm assuming \"yes\") Great! Anything that a piece of code prints, is shown beneath it.\n",

    "You even have the ability to change the code, and see what happens if you change it. For instance, in the code above, change the text “Hello, world!” to something else (but make sure you leave the double quotes in place, and do not use double quotes in your own text). Run the code, and see how it displays your own text. Be aware, however, that this actually changes your notebook; you cannot simply revert back to the original version of the notebook, unless you upload or copy a “clean” version. You can make copies and/or create “checkpoints” for the notebook in the “File” menu.\n",

When you double click on a text, or sometimes accidentally “scroll” into the text from code, suddenly the text is shown on a grey background and with different formatting. You can return the text to the regular visualization by “running it” (pressing Ctrl+Enter). I would love to lock the texts, but in the current version of the notebooks that is not possible. I am sure that we get that feature in the future, but for now we have to make do."

    "Before we continue with the material, I want to give some information that will hopefully get you in the right mindset if you are unfamiliar with programming. The programming course is really like no other course you have seen in Communication and Information Sciences. The way you learn how to program is by failing a bunch of times until the code finally does what you want it to do. So don't get discouraged when things do not work! When the output is \"wrong\" or you get an error, it does not mean you are bad at programming, it just means that you are working towards the right answer. :) What is very typical is that you work for ages on one of the more challenging exercises, and then when you finally get the right anwer, you think \"Ah jeez, all that work and it was just a few lines of code.\" That's totally normal and part of the process of learning how to program! As I said in the lecture: it is all a puzzle and puzzles are fun. The most important skill when you work on a challenging exercise is to not feel overwhelmed by it, but rather try to break the exercise down into its core components. When you know the steps that you need to undertake to finish an exercise, the hardest part is over. Also important to note: Google is your friend! Functions are explained in more detail on the Python website, and the website [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) probably has the answer to all of your issues (well, not \\*all\\* of your issues, but you know what I mean). So if you add `site:stackoverflow.com` to your Google query, you should be able to find someone who was experiencing a similar issue, and the way to solve it. Figuring out the best way to Google your issues is an important programming (and life) skill."

    "**[Exercise 7]** We're going to re-use the formula from Exercise 5, where for some reason, you want to convert bananas to weight in kilograms. As a reminder: 1 banana weighs about 0.113 kilograms, so the formula is `x * 0.113` where `x` is the number of bananas, and we'd like to be able to freely change this value of `x`. We want to store the total weight in kilograms in the variable `bananas`.\n",

Too heavy.\"` or `\"[x] bananas weigh [bananas] total. I can carry this.\"` Where `x` and `bananas` correspond with the values of the variables `x` and `bananas`. So if you change the value of `x`, the output of `x` and `bananas` should change as well. Hint: look up how you can change data types."

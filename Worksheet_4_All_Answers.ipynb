    "## File Paths and the OS module\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are interacting with files on our system, the location that we use matters a lot. You do not want to delete the wrong folder, for instance, or overwrite important files. That is why it is always important to pay attention to file paths, make sure they are referring to the right location and the right file. First of all, an important distinction I want to make is between **files** and **directories**:\n",
    "\n",
    " - files -- These contain information. Think of Python files, or Txt files, which we are working with today.\n",
    " - directories -- These contain files and directories *inside of* them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two ways to indicate which directory we want to interact with: **absolute** and **relative** file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute file paths are basically the full file path on your computer. It starts from a root directory, noted by a `/` (Mac and Linux) or a `C:` (Windows). For example, `/Users/example_user/Desktop` or `C:/Users/example_user/Desktop`, refers you to the Desktop on a Mac and Windows, respectively. An absolute file path describes how to access a given file or directory, starting from the root of the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative file paths are notated by a lack of a leading forward slash. For example, the code block examples we have seen in this Worksheet all contain examples of relative file paths (e.g., `'./Movies/All_Movies.txt'`). A relative file path is interpreted from the perspective of your current working directory. In a sense, whenever you use a relative file path, it is joined with your current directory to create an absolute file path. That is, if my current working directory is `C:/Users/example_user/Desktop` and I use a relative file path of `./Movies`, then that is equivalent to using tho absolute file path `C:/Users/example_user/Desktop/Movies`. With relative file paths, two special characters are important to remember: `./` (which means \"the folder of the current directory\") and `../` (which means \"the folder that contains the current directory\"). We will mostly use the `./` one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a relative file path from the wrong directory, then the path will refer to a different file than you intend, or it will not refer to any file at all. So an absolute file path can be nice as it will work from any directory on your computer. However, an advantage of a relative file path is that it works on any computer: if I added my full file path `C:/Users/Chris/Desktop/Movies/Barbie.txt` in the code block examples, it would have caused an error on your computer if your account name is not *Chris* and if you are not working with a *Windows* Operating System. That is why I prefer working with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you may wonder when using a relative path is \"But what is actually my current working directory?\" that is one of the things where the OS module can help you with. The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. Think for instance of functions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Locating the Current Working Directory\n",
    "- Creating a Directory\n",
    "- Listing out Files and Directories with Python\n",
    "- Deleting Directory or Files using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### os.getcwd()\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a python program (or Jupyter Notebook), its current working directory is initialized to the location of that program/notebook. It can be retrieved using the function `os.getcwd()`."

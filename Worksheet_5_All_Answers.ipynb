External libraries allow us to use even more functions. Whatever you want to do, you can probably find an external library somewhere that facilitates this with Python. That's partly why Python is such a powerful and useful programming language: there is a big community of people using it and making all these external libraries so that it can be used for all kinds of purposes. As discussed in the video lecture, you can install external libraries using Anaconda Prompt, and then using \"pip install [library_name]\". Alternatively, and what we are going to do now: you can just run the bit of code below, and if all goes well, it should just install the necessary library for these exercises."

    "For this week's assignment, you can find three Excel files on Canvas (`Babynames_VerySmall.xlsx`, `Babynames_Small.xlsx` and `Babynames_Large.xlsx`). These Excel files contain American baby names from 2000-2020 (originally from [this website](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html)). If you scroll through the Excel file, you will see that the names are sorted alphabetically for each year, so the first rows are the alphabetically ordered names from 2000, then the names from 2001, 2002, etc. `Babynames_Small.xlsx` is just a smaller version from the large dataset where I have removed all names that occur less than 100 times. And for `Babynames_VerySmall.xlsx` we only have names occurring more than 10,000 times. So, just to be clear: all datasets are usable for the exercises, but especially when testing things out, **I recommend using `Babynames_VerySmall.xlsx`**."
